Visualizes your MAL anime using `three.js`. 
* Creates a text sprite that appears as 3d block text of the anime's title and attaches that to a corresponding spherical mesh. The sphere's size and number of segments depend on the user's score for that anime. The larger the score, the larger the sphere will be. Furthermore, the x and y coordinate of the sphere is also dependent on the score. The higher the score, the closer the sphere will be to the center. The y coordinate is simply the order in which the anime appears on the list.
